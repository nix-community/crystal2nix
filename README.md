Unit Tests

These tests can  run offline and thus within the nix sandbox without network connectivity.


`make check`

All Tests

In our integrated test cases, we focus on validating that the shard.lock file created during the process is a valid and correctly structured file. These tests ensure that the output generated by our code aligns with expected standards and accurately reflects the dependencies required for the project. 

To run all available test cases, including integration tests, use:

`make all-tests`

These commands ensure that your changes are tested thoroughly before being pushed to the repository.
